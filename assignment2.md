# Story Research 

  * What has already been done:
This issue has really taken off in the last five years as a result of researchers and climate journalists beginning to investigate deeply into the effects of climate change and how it relates to the weather. Purdue University published a report in 2016 called the [Purdue Tornado Alley Report](https://www.purdue.edu/research/features/stories/center-of-u-s-tornado-activity-shifting-east-and-south-possibly-due-to-climate-change/) that analyzed data from the previous 60 years to look for a shift in the location of annual tornado activity in the United States. According to the study, the classic "tornado alley" of the central plains had a significant drop in yearly counts and tornado days. Additionally, a [research conducted in 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0048-2) indicated that the number of tornadoes has usually dropped over the last four decades within Tornado Alley, but the number of tornadoes has increased just to the east, over the Lower Great Lakes, and into the Deep South. 

  * What has NOT been done:
So, although the research has already been completed, maybe I can supplement it with data from more specific states or focus on the execution of the tornadoes rather than the frequency. Just because it has previously been done in a "is this happening" type of fashion doesn't mean I won't attempt to locate my own data and construct my own analysis/story. The majority of the publications discuss how this trend is occurring as a result of changes in temperature, sea levels, and the frequency of hurricanes. Should I attempt to simulate the impact level of these tornadoes? Or maybe the reality of the amount it has changed in the previous few of years? I remember tornado season in 2021 being really sluggish in tornado alley since I took a tornado class at Purdue during that time and ut was commonly talked about and instead they were occuring throughout Alabama and Mississippi. I'm not sure, I may need to look at additional data; any comments from you would be much appreciated thank you!

 Three high-quality datasets....

1. Storm Prediction Center
* [1999 Fatalties Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/1999deadlytorn.html)
* [2007 Fatalties Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/1999deadlytorn.html)
* [2017 Tornado Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/2017_annual_summary.html#) 
* [2000 Tornado Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/2000_annual_summary.html)

Trustworthy- Since the National Weather Service is in charge of SPC and makes sure it is operating properly, I consider it to be a highly reliable source. The data may be segmented by year, month, and even minute in addition to geography, which makes it possible to extend a large variety of data that can be separated into many parts by place and depending on whether you are analyzing physical torndoes, duration, or fatalities.

Limitations- It is possible that I did not seek hard enough, but it was difficult to obtain data from before the year 2000. This restricts the scope of my comparison since I wanted to look at a longer range of change, possibly beginning in the 1990s and continuing up to the present day. Either I will have to condense the timeframe, or I will have to locate another source.
   
2. NOAA Storm Data publication
* [November 2018 Storm Data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/orders/IPS/IPS-A293214E-77FC-4079-B260-FD85C97F13B3.pdf)

Trustworthy-  I believe NOAA is a reliable source, but please correct me if I am mistaken. This source does not seem to be untrustworthy in my opinion.

Limitations- Anayalsis does not seem to be straightforward. Not sure whether this is a restriction, but it covers more than only tornadoes, which would be a little difficult to go through for the data that I really want. Also this is not a limitation, but I like how they have a summary of the storm event that took place and what the National Weather Service surveyed. 

3. FEMA 
* [Tornado Risks and Hazards in the Southeastern United States](https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/tornado-risk-hazards-southeast_recovery-advisory.pdf)

Trustworthy-FEMA is a trustworthy souce to me! 

Limitations- Due to the nature of this data PDF, which is in the form of a policy brief or action request, there are bound to be certain limitations. As a result, extracting relevant data from the document might be a challenging task. Nevertheless, I believe that the policy might be useful in moving my organization in the direction that I would want it to go. In addition to this, it provides helpful background material that supports my article proposal about tornadoes increasing in frequency in the Southeastern United States.
