# Story Research 

  * What has already been done
This issue has really taken off in the last five years as a result of researchers and climate journalists beginning to investigate deeply into the effects of climate change and how it relates to the weather. Purdue University published a report in 2016 called the [Purdue Tornado Alley Report](https://www.purdue.edu/research/features/stories/center-of-u-s-tornado-activity-shifting-east-and-south-possibly-due-to-climate-change/) that analyzed data from the previous 60 years to look for a shift in the location of annual tornado activity in the United States. According to the study, the classic "tornado alley" of the central plains had a significant drop in yearly counts and tornado days. Additionally, a [research conducted in 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-018-0048-2) indicated that the number of tornadoes has usually dropped over the last four decades within Tornado Alley, but the number of tornadoes has increased just to the east, over the Lower Great Lakes, and into the Deep South. 

  * What has NOT been done 


 Three high-quality datasets....

1. Storm Prediction Center
* [1999 Fatalties Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/1999deadlytorn.html)
* [2007 Fatalties Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/1999deadlytorn.html)
* [2017 Tornado Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/2017_annual_summary.html#) 
* [2000 Tornado Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/2000_annual_summary.html)

Trustworthy- Since the National Weather Service is in charge of SPC and makes sure it is operating properly, I consider it to be a highly reliable source. The data may be segmented by year, month, and even minute in addition to geography, which makes it possible to extend a large variety of data that can be separated into many parts by place and depending on whether you are analyzing physical torndoes, duration, or fatalities.

Limitations- It is possible that I did not seek hard enough, but it was difficult to obtain data from before the year 2000. This restricts the scope of my comparison since I wanted to look at a longer range of change, possibly beginning in the 1990s and continuing up to the present day. Either I will have to condense the timeframe, or I will have to locate another source.
