# Story Research 

  * What has already been done
  * What has NOT been done 
  * Three high-quality datasets 
1. Storm Prediction Center
* [1999 Fatalties Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/1999deadlytorn.html)
* [2007 Fatalties Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/torn/1999deadlytorn.html)
* [2017 Tornado Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/2017_annual_summary.html#) 
* [2000 Tornado Report](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/online/monthly/2000_annual_summary.html)

Trustworthy- Since the National Weather Service is in charge of SPC and makes sure it is operating properly, I consider it to be a highly reliable source. The data may be segmented by year, month, and even minute in addition to geography, which makes it possible to extend a large variety of data that can be separated into many parts by place and depending on whether you are analyzing physical torndoes, duration, or fatalities.
Limitations- It is possible that I did not seek hard enough, but it was difficult to obtain data from before the year 2000. This restricts the scope of my comparison since I wanted to look at a longer range of change, possibly beginning in the 1990s and continuing up to the present day. Either I will have to condense the timeframe, or I will have to locate another source.
