# Problems that could be within my data: 

Values are missing: This is something that is going to occur with the weather data; not every tornado will be accurate
or contain particular data like it does for some others, so I may have to find a way to get around it in some instances.
Because such storms are more powerful, it is possible that I will be able to collect more information if I can narrow my 
attention to the more extreme (F3-F%) tornadoes

Data are too coarse: This is somewhat the case for me with FEMA; nevertheless, I am currently looking for further information
on the topic. I am seeing a lot of statistics from FEMA that offer year spans, but the specifics I want to know about are particular
storms and weather events, not years or even months. Hopefully, there is more that is on the way very soon.

Data are intermingled with formatting and annotations: The data that I need to get into a spreadsheet from the weather forecast center
is giving me a lot of trouble. There are some links, but they don't seem to be working, and for others, like the fatality report, I can't
even locate the link to click on. Do you have any suggestions for this situation? Should I transfer the data from the spreadsheet into the
spreadsheet if I cannot locate the downloaded data? Perhaps I need to examine more carefully. There will be further analysis.
