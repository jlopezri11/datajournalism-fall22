# 1. Critique of Data-Driven Investigation
  Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below       expectations ----- **5**

* What was it? ---- **The reporter was trying to communicate how Hurricane Harvy in Texas was both a natural distaer and a man-made disaster that was caused by a 50-year build-up of neglect.**

* Was it in the headline? ---- **Not necessarily.** 

* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent ----- **3**

* Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?---- **Not in my opinion.**

* Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?---- **Each section was shaped and organized in an effective manner. However, some sections were behind a pay wall. I would have liked more information inmbedded in the initial vizualization that caught my attention in the first place. Instead, I had to go to each article to find the data.**
*  Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate ---- **5**

* List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.---- **To be honest, all the data seemed relativey accuarte to me. It talked a lot about inches of rain that fell and money spent on rebuilding. I was not suprised by the numbers and followed Hurrican Harvey relatively closely when it all happened. Nothing seemed out of place for me.**

* List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.

* Did they provide a source?

* Did they explain everything that needed explaining?

Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.)

* Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.

* Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?

* Look like it all belonged together?

* Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?

* Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?

* Type (1-5)

* Explain

* Color (1-5)

* Explain

Creativity
* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?-----**Yes, I believe the piece did do a good job creatively. Their main points...

* How?

* Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5.
