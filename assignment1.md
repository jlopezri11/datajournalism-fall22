# 1. Critique of Data-Driven Investigation
  Clarity and accuracy
* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below       expectations **5**

* What was it? **The reporter was trying to communicate how Hurricane Harvy in Texas was both a natural distaer and a man-made disaster that was caused by a 50-year build-up of neglect.**

* Was it in the headline? **Not necessarily.** 

* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent **3**

* Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization?**Not in my opinion.**

* Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? **Each section was shaped and organized in an effective manner. However, some sections were behind a pay wall. I would have liked more information inmbedded in the initial vizualization that caught my attention in the first place. Instead, I had to go to each article to find the data.**
*  Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate **5**

* List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data.**To be honest, all the data seemed relativey accuarte to me. It talked a lot about inches of rain that fell and money spent on rebuilding. I was not suprised by the numbers and followed Hurrican Harvey relatively closely when it all happened. Nothing seemed out of place for me.**

* List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. **The National Hurricane Center, Southeast Coastal Ocean Observing Regional Association, weather.gov, 

* Did they provide a source? **There were a lot of interviews with officals but I never found a prominent source of where they got their data.**

* Did they explain everything that needed explaining? **I believe so, the story had a lot of different angle to do, beside the basic facts of the Hurricane and its destruction. it went into depth on the Texas govenrmnet for a moment and how the state contributed to its loss. I also lked the piece about the Netherlands and how the Dutch government could be a soltuion to the water crisis given their experience. I spent a lot of my life living in the Netherlanda and never thought to write about an angle such as this but its true and needs telling.**

Quality
* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) **4**

* Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. **More use of fonts and coor could have been executed. Also, more graphics or charts in the orginal slideshow could have been added as well.**

* Type and color (if piece includes graphics) **Interactive infographic/slideshow of pictures with text in front of pictures.**

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose? **Even though I have very little abilities of my own, I feel as if they could have done more in terms of the colors and fonts used. It seemed to be quite simple. Especially the first slide, which did not have a prominent font or anything else that made it stand out.** 

* Look like it all belonged together?**Yes, it seemed as if everything belonged together and fit together extremely nicely. The images were arranged in a manner that would complement the overall presentation.**

* Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information? **Yes, the slideshow give sthe main points of the articles first before you read them.**

* Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue? **Yes, I was not confused by graphics or visualizations.**

* Type (1-5)**4**

* Explain **I believe the graphics were effective in complemnting and adding to the narratives.**

* Color (1-5) **3**

* Explain **More color within fonts could have been used.**

Creativity
* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you?-----**Yes, I believe the piece did do a good job creatively. Their main points were detailed in the beginning of the slideshow/vizualition, which caught my attention immediately. I  liked how orgnaized each section and article was in the original visuialization. It is a creative approach to highlight what will be talked about. However, the actual articles themselves could have had more visuals.**

* How? **The presentation offered a pleasant viewing and reading experience overall.**

* Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. **4**

# 2. Story Pitch 

The reason I chose to edit the story above is because I had this idea that I want to create something very much like it. I like reporting on politics very much, but weirdly enough, I've also always had a fascination for the weather, and I'd really want to collect some data about it so that I may finally turn it into a narrative. I couldn't help but think of the storms that struck Puerto Rico. Both Hurricane Maria and Hurricane Fiona have wreaked havoc over the whole island, leaving the people of Puerto Rico with the aftermath of a disaster that will take years to repair. I want to look at hurricanes, the action and safety measures that are in place there, and the amount of time it takes to recover after an event of this magnitude.

This narrative has a lot to say on the topic of climate change, which makes it relevant to modern times. Natural disasters such as hurricanes are occurring at a higher frequency and with more destructive potential each year. I would want to concentrate on the people of Puerto Rico and investigate the history of hurricanes that have affected the island. Have they become even more problematic? What kinds of effects do storms have on a yearly basis? Are there signs of an increase in safety measures? Is it the same as the narrative that was told before, and is the way politics is handled affecting how issues are dealt with?
